This is would be very important to know to plot a bar graph using pandas DataFrame. You don’t have to install any pandas library if you are using Google Colab notebook then just import it. Otherwise, you have to manually install it in your command prompt by saying pip install pandas. The reason for aliasing (pd) is that I don’t have to write to pandas every single time when I want to use any methods by aliasing I can write pd.method name instead."

You have to append the new data frame to the existing data frame like df.append(df2) (existing. append(new data frame)), now inside the append function we have some other parameters as ignore_index = True, this prevents the data frame from appending new index, so in this example all the index are in a continuous fashion (incrementing), and the next parameter is a sort = False this is because we don’t want to sort the data according to the index, otherwise our data would be completely a mixture, you can play with these parameters by changing the values as False and True respectively and note the difference.

    "Hence this is how you can calculate the part-time earnings using a pandas data frame with a python. I know this is easy to understand because I have given as much as an explanation of the code I could and the rest you can practice on your own. This is a good start if you know little about pandas library, these are some basic methods that should be at your fingertips. I’m going to stop here and let you practice the code. If you have any doubts, let me know in the comments section, or drop a mail to tanunprabhu95@gmail.com just let me know your issue and I will definitely solve your problem. Moreover I am an author in [towardsdatascience.com](https://medium.com/@tanunprabhu95) and you can find this [article](https://medium.com/@tanunprabhu95/manipulating-the-data-with-pandas-using-python-be6c5dfabd47) there.
