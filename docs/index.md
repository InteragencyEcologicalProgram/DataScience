## Welcome to the [IEP](https://iep.ca.gov/) Data Science PWT

A statistical help group for people who love fish, wildlife, water, and writing code.

Also useful for people who hate statistics, coding, and math, but need to learn how to use it. We will convert you! Post your question to our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bay-delta-datascience) and one of your fellow scientists may be able to offer advice. This group is intended to be a collaborative learning experience for all members. We meet quarterly for half-day workshops that cover a variety of topics, including statistics, R, Python, open data practices, data management, data cleaning, and anything else we want. Each meeting will have at least one presentation geared towards beginners.

Co-Chairs: [Rosemary Hartman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosemary-hartman-1b3b53bb/) ([DWR](https://water.ca.gov/)) and [Travis Hinkelman](https://www.travishinkelman.com/) ([ESA](https://esassoc.com/))
