Hi Folks,

Welcome to the presentation on working with Git and GitHub. I am by no means an expert with said technology but have been using it with good success for version control and particularly with collaboration.

In this presentation, we'll learn about downloading Git and some simple commands to get started. We'll talk a bit about remote repositories (GitHub) and how GitHub can facilitate collaboration and working on multiple devices (e.g., work computer, work laptop, home computer).

Lastly, we'll cover using Git/GitHub from RStudio. Some nice features in RStudio make it nearly effortless to use version control and to "push" and "pull" to and from a remote repository.

Below are some resources for more in-depth pursuit of Git. Enjoy.
